# FEMFX-UE5
AMD FEMFX Plugin for Unreal Engine 5.3 based on the original [GPUOpen FEMFX-4.18 Plugin](https://github.com/GPUOpenSoftware/UnrealEngine/tree/FEMFX-4.18)

This is an update to make the old plugin work in UE5.3, I don't own the code, copyright reserved to the original plugin for UE4.18 devs.

**The current version of this plugin can't compile because I'm trying to update the FEMFXRender (now FEMFXLocalVertexFactory) based on the new LocalVertexFactory from UE5.3 source code to try to make the mesh visible again. Now it has a Linking error so if you can fix it open an issue and make a pull request with the fix ;)**

> [!WARNING]  
I archived this repo because there's a new FEM plugin inside Unreal Engine 5 called Chaos Flesh.
